## [unreleased]

### Added

- Transfer credential ownership to another user.
- Create credentials via form interface which is defined by a JSON schema. (The
  available JSON schemas will be provided by adaptors, in most cases: e.g.,
  `language-dhis2` provides a single schema which defines the required
  attributes for `state.configuration`, while `language-common` provides
  multiple schemas—things like "oauth" or "basic auth" which define attributes
  for `state.configuration` which might be used by lots of different
  jobs/adaptors.)
- Show "projects with access" in credentials list view.
- Show job in runs list and run view.

### Fixed

- User menu (top right) appears on top of all other components.
- User profile screen integrated with the rest of the liveview app.
